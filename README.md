<h1 align="center">LED Morse Code for Raspberry Pi</h1>

<h2>About this project</h2>
This project turns text that you input into morse code by flashing an LED light.

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Raspberry Pi - I am using a Pi 3 but any version will work</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Jumper Wires</li>
  <li>LED Light</li>
  <li>Resistor - I am using a 220 Î© Resistor</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting Set Up</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Clone the repository</h3>
Open your terminal on the Raspberry Pi and navigate to the directory you want to program to be. Next, you will need to type: 
<pre><code>"git clone https://github.com/Stevenchi36/LED-Morse-Code-for-Raspberry-Pi"</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2: Setting up the breadboard</h3>

<p>Refer to the image above for assistance with the next 3 steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect a jumper wire from pin 26 to the longer connection(anode) on the LED.(The blue wire in the picture above).</li>
  <li>Connect a wire from a ground pin to the a seperate row on the breadboard.(The green wire in the picture above).</li>
  <li>Connect the resistor from the ground connection to the shorter end(cathode) of the LED</li>
  Now you should be all set up to run the program!
</ol>
