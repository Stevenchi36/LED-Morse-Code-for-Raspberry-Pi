<h1 align="center">LED Morse Code for Raspberry Pi</h1>

The led is powered by pin 26 in this project, but that can easily be changed by altering the number on line 6 where it says "led = LED(26)"

This program works with all letters in the English Alphabet, all numbers, and a good amount of punctuation. If the character that you enter is not valid, it will just print out that it is not supported and continue with the rest of the characters.
